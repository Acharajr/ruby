# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 5
# puts 2

# puts 5 + 2
# puts 5 * 2
# puts 5 - 2
# puts 5 / 2.0

# adding a decimal to a value is called a float and it is not the same as an interger

# Non-numbers

# puts "what it do baybee"
# puts "tacos are" + " delicioso"
# puts "tacos" * 3

# True, False

# puts true 
# puts false
# puts 3 == 2

# Nothing

# Variables

# dogs = 5
# cats = 2

# # puts dogs + cats
# food = "tacos"
# quantity = 3

# puts food * quantity 
# # variables only live on the file and is not accesible in another file
# # Combine strings and variables
# puts "I want #{quantity} #{food}"

# name = "Achara"
# puts "Hello, #{name}"


# String manipulation
