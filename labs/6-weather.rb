# EXERCISE
# Given the following Ruby hash that represents weather data,
# write a weather summary out to the screen. Something like this:

# Currently it is 67 degrees and Sunny.
# Forecast for the next 7 days:
# - 65 degres and Mostly Cloudy
# - 70 degrees and Partly Cloudy
# - 62 degrees and Sunny
# - 68 degrees and Sunny
# - 65 degrees and Partly Cloudy with a 70% chance of rain
